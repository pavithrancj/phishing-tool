# 🎣 Phishing Attack Simulation & Awareness Tool (Educational Purpose)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is an **educational simulation** designed to raise awareness about the **consequences of phishing attacks**. Using real-world tactics such as email spoofing and website cloning, this demo showcases how unsuspecting users can be tricked into revealing sensitive information.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This project is created **solely for academic and awareness purposes**. It is not intended for malicious use. All demonstrations were conducted in a controlled environment with fictional data.

## 🔍 Objective

- Demonstrate how phishing works — from reconnaissance to execution.
- Show users how attackers **clone websites**, craft **fake login pages**, and **extract credentials**.
- Help people understand **how vulnerable they might be** to social engineering attacks.
- Promote **security awareness** and guide users toward **safer online behavior**.

## 🛠️ Project Modules

1. **Cloning the Target Website**  
   Replicating the appearance of a legitimate website to trick users into trusting the phishing page.

2. **Phishing Script for Data Extraction**  
   Captures user credentials entered into the spoofed form and stores them for simulation.

3. **Python Code for Managing the Process**  
   Automates backend operations including logging, storing input, and showing fake success messages.

4. **Server Integration**  
   Host the cloned website on a local or test server to simulate real phishing attack behavior.
